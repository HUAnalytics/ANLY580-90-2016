## Objectives

This assigment will help you familiarize yourself with the process of writing reproducible code and with sharing that code through a social portal such as GitHub.  

Your code is (theoretically) because the assignment was due last week.  Since then you were asked to setup a GitHub account.  Now you will use that account to add your code to this repo.  

Your tasks are:
- Fork the repo to your local machine
- Add your code below your name
- Add some description of the vis and the data set above your graphic
- Test your code on your local machine to verify execution
- Create a pull request to submit your code to the master branch

No doubt this will require some reading and thoughtful research on your part.  A great source of information can be found at http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/

A *treemap* is a visual representation of a hierarchical (tree-like) dataset.  In which each branch of hierarchy is represented by rectangle.  The appearence of the treemap (size & color of rectangles) is scaled in relation to one or multiple varibles in the dataset.

Below is my example of a vis created with the `treemap` package using the `GNI2014` dataset, which is a listing of Gross Domestic Income in USD.


```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(treemap)   # Loading the treemap library
data(GNI2014)      # Included dataset on Gross National Income levels
treemap(GNI2014,                     # data frme
       index=c("continent", "iso3"), # a vector of aggregation indices from df
       vSize="population",           # identify the column that defines size
       vColor="GNI",                 # second vector to map to color
       type="value",                 # a type (7 choices)
       title="Gross National Income (per captia) in USD in 2014")
```

A *rUnemploymentData* contains data and visualization functions for USA unemployment data from 2000 to 2013. Data comes from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Below is my example of a vis created with the `rUnemploymentData` package using the `df_state_unemployment` dataset, which is a distribution of unemployment rate in 10 States of the U.S.
```{r, echo=TRUE,fig.width=10}
library(rUnemploymentData)   #load rUnemploymentData library
library(reshape)             #load reshape library
library(ggplot2)            #load ggplot2 library

data(df_state_unemployment)

pick<-sort(sample(51,10)) 
db3<-melt(df_state_unemployment[pick,c(1,10:15)],
          id="region")                       #manipulate data and pick 10 states out of 51 states
colnames(db3)<-c("Region","Year","Rate")     #rename the column names

ggplot(data = db3, aes(Region,Rate))+ 
  geom_boxplot(colour="blue")+               #apply ggplot function with box plot
  geom_jitter(aes(colour=Year,shape=Year))+  #add jitter
  ggtitle("Unemployment Rate distribution in 10 States of U.S.after the Financial Crisis")   #add title
```
