## Objectives

This assigment will help you familiarize yourself with the process of writing reproducible code and with sharing that code through a social portal such as GitHub.  

Your code is (theoretically) because the assignment was due last week.  Since then you were asked to setup a GitHub account.  Now you will use that account to add your code to this repo.  

Your tasks are:
- Fork the repo to your local machine
- Add your code below your name
- Add some description of the vis and the data set above your graphic
- Test your code on your local machine to verify execution
- Create a pull request to submit your code to the master branch

No doubt this will require some reading and thoughtful research on your part.  A great source of information can be found at http://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/

A *treemap* is a visual representation of a hierarchical (tree-like) dataset.  In which each branch of hierarchy is represented by rectangle.  The appearence of the treemap (size & color of rectangles) is scaled in relation to one or multiple varibles in the dataset.

Below is my example of a vis created with the `treemap` package using the `GNI2014` dataset, which is a listing of Gross Domestic Income in USD.


```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(treemap)   # Loading the treemap library
data(GNI2014)      # Included dataset on Gross National Income levels
treemap(GNI2014,                     # data frme
       index=c("continent", "iso3"), # a vector of aggregation indices from df
       vSize="population",           # identify the column that defines size
       vColor="GNI",                 # second vector to map to color
       type="value",                 # a type (7 choices)
       title="Gross National Income (per captia) in USD in 2014")
```

This package offers an alternative. The data.tree package lets you create hierarchies, called data.tree structures. The building block of theses structures are Node objects. The package provides basic traversal, search, and sort operations, and an infrastructure for recursive tree programming. You can decorate Nodes with your own fields and methods, so as to extend the package to your needs.

The package also provides convenience methods for neatly printing and plotting trees. It supports conversion from and to data.frames, lists, and other tree structures such as dendrogram, phylo objects from the ape package, igraph, and other packages.

Technically, data.tree structures are bi-directional, ordered trees. Bi-directional means that you can navigate from parent to chidren and vice versa. Ordered means that the sort order of the children of a parent node is well-defined.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(data.tree) # Loading the data.tree library
library(networkD3) # Loading the networkD3 library
data(acme) # Included dataset of Sample Data: A Simple Company with Departments
acmeNetwork <- ToDataFrameNetwork(acme, "name") #Transform into frame network
simpleNetwork(acmeNetwork[-3], fontSize = 12) #Plot and settings
